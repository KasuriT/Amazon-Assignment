# Amazon-Assignment
**Purpose**
This framework for automated tests is the implementation of a practical software assignment to one of the company's tester positions.
Amazon web pages are automated by writing test suites using selenium-webdriver and TestNg as testing framework

**The following key modules/pages are automated:**
- Start the selected Browser
- Search Product
- Sort Product 
- Select Product

Key test cases(totalÂ 4) are written for each module and test suites created including the positive and negative test cases.
A state-transition flow of test-cases are designed and run like a user searching a product from the Amazon site.
For failed test cases it will take a screen-shot as well at the point of failure.
